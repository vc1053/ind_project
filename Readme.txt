Designing a mechanism to present a sequence of questions for a guessing game. Guess the Pattern is an analogy
of the game 20 Questions, where a user thinks of a design pattern and the game is trying to guess it by asking
yes/no questions.

The game has two inputs “yes” and “no”. They are handled in the corresponding methods answerYes() and answerNo() in
the Game class. The Game class also has start() method to initiate the game and show the first question

The game interacts with the user interface in two ways: to display a question and to exit the game. The Game object
has a reference to a GameContext object that handles these interactions.

The class Diagram and the explanation of the solution will be in the word document that I upload for this assignment
